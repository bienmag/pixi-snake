# pixi-football-snake
A fun and simple game inspired by the classic Snake game, but with a football twist! This game is built using Pixi.js and JavaScript, and it's designed to entertain football enthusiasts and casual gamers alike.

## How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of your snake. Collect as many footballs as you can. The game is designed that it doesn't end when running into the walls.

## Future Features
- add scoring
- snake self-stop when running into it's own tail
- smoother snake growth
- refactor the code:)

 ## To run on your machine 
 Simply clone the repo, run yarn install and then yarn dev
